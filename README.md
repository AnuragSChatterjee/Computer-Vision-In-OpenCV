# Computer-Vision-In-OpenCV
After completing a Computer Vision course on Kaggle and having after earned a Certificate In Computer Vision, I thought of practicing some OpenCV concepts from the documentation to improve my understanding of OpenCV and Computer Vision using a photo of myself as an image sample, and played around with my image to make some modifications.

Files (Images) used for my own practice:
